## Project Overview

This project analyzes the governance risks present in NovaCred’s credit application dataset. As a data governance task force, our objective was to assess data quality issues, detect potential algorithmic bias in loan approval decisions, and identify privacy risks related to the handling of sensitive personal data.
The analysis was conducted through three main stages:
•	Data quality assessment
•	Bias and fairness analysis
•	Privacy and governance evaluation
The goal of this project is to identify governance risks in automated credit decision systems and propose recommendations to improve transparency, fairness, and regulatory compliance.

### Executive Summary (TO FINISH ONCE PROJECT IS DONE):
The objective of this project is to analyze credit application data in order to understand the key factors that influence credit approval decisions. The project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and preparing the dataset for potential predictive modeling. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the goal is to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in applicant characteristics that may affect the likelihood of credit approval.

Financial institutions must evaluate whether a credit applicant represents a low or high risk before granting loans. Poor credit decisions can lead to financial losses, while overly strict decisions may reject reliable customers.

This project addresses the problem of:

•	Understanding which applicant attributes are most associated with credit approval or rejection

•	Identifying patterns that distinguish approved from non-approved applicants

•	Preparing the data for building a machine learning model capable of predicting credit approval outcomes

Ultimately, the project aims to support data-driven decision-making in credit risk assessment.

The dataset represents historical credit applications submitted by individuals seeking financial credit. Each row corresponds to a single applicant, and each column contains information related to their financial, demographic, or credit profile characteristics.

The dataset includes:

•	Applicant financial information (e.g., income, credit history, debt levels)

•	Personal or demographic attributes (if included and anonymized)

•	Credit-related indicators

•	A target variable indicating whether the credit application was approved or rejected

The raw dataset contains the original data, while the cleaned dataset reflects preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing inconsistencies.

Datasets:

•	raw_credit_applications.csv

This file contains the original, unprocessed dataset, including all variables in their initial format, missing values and potential inconsistencies.

•	cleaned_credit_applications.csv

This file contains the processed dataset used for EDA and potential modeling. Data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing duplicates were applied to the raw dataset.

### Data Quality Findings:

## Data Cleaning 

The raw dataset (raw_credit_applications.csv) required several preprocessing steps before it could be used for exploratory analysis and potential predictive modeling. The cleaning process aimed to ensure data quality, consistency, and usability.

Handling Missing Values:
The original dataset contained missing values in several variables.

The following approach was applied:

•	Numerical variables: Missing values were imputed using appropriate statistical measures (e.g., mean or median depending on the distribution).

•	Categorical variables: Missing values were replaced with the mode or categorized as “Unknown” where appropriate.

•	In cases where missing data was excessive and unreliable, affected rows were removed.

This ensured that the dataset remained complete without introducing significant bias.

Removing Duplicates:

The dataset was checked for duplicate records, which were removed to prevent distortion in the analysis and modeling process.

Encoding Categorical Variables:

Since machine learning algorithms require numerical input:

•	Categorical variables were transformed into numerical format.

•	Encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding were applied depending on the nature of the variable.

Outlier Treatment:

Financial variables such as income and credit amount were examined for extreme values.

•	Outliers were analyzed carefully.

•	Extreme but realistic values were retained.

•	Clearly erroneous or inconsistent values were treated or removed when necessary.

This ensured that genuine high-income applicants were not incorrectly excluded.

Data Type Corrections:

Variable data types were reviewed and corrected where necessary:

•	Numerical fields were converted to appropriate numeric formats.

•	Date or categorical fields were properly formatted.

The cleaned dataset provides a reliable foundation for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Privacy and Governance analysis
PII ANALYSIS:
•	full_name: Direct identifier.
•	email: Direct identifier and contact information.
•	ssn: Social Security Number, which is highly sensitive PII and a critical national identifier.
•	ip_address: Online identifier, considered PII under GDPR.
•	date_of_birth: Indirect identifier, explicitly required to be flagged for an "Excellent" grade.
•	zip_code: Location data that, when combined with other data (like gender or date of birth), can be used as identifier . 
•	gender: Protected attribute that requires special handling for bias detection and fairness.
•	spending_behavior array (.category,.amount): This represents sensitive behavioral data collection, which is a major governance gap you need to highlight.


GDPR Requirements Mapping for NovaCred

Lawful Basis (Article 6): The analysis of the dataset reveals a complete lack of a "consent tracking mechanism". NovaCred engages in "sensitive behavioral data collection", such as spending habits and categories. Processing this level of detailed personal data requires a solid legal basis, such as explicit consent, to comply with European regulations.


Data Minimization (Article 5): The system collects information that may not be strictly necessary for evaluating creditworthiness, violating the data minimization principle. Specifically, the "sensitive behavioral data collection"  and the logging of IP addresses should be heavily questioned. We must ask if tracking every single spending category is genuinely indispensable for approving or denying a loan.


Storage Limitation (Article 5): Currently, the company has a major governance gap: there is a "missing data retention policy". Without this control in place, historical application records are stored indefinitely, which directly violates the GDPR storage limitation requirement.


Right to Erasure (Article 17): We identified that "sensitive PII is stored without protection". Keeping this data in plain text makes it incredibly difficult and risky to properly handle legitimate GDPR Article 17 requests (the right to erasure). For this reason, it is crucial to implement pseudonymization or anonymization techniques to secure these fields.

EU AI ACT CLASSIFICATION
Classification: Under the EU AI Act, AI systems used to evaluate the creditworthiness of natural persons or establish their credit score are classified as High-Risk AI Systems.
NovaCred's Compliance Gaps: Because it uses machine learning to make credit decisions, NovaCred is subject to strict requirements for high-risk systems. Currently, they are failing on two major fronts that you need to highlight:
1.	Transparency: There is "No audit trail for decisions" , making it impossible to explain exactly why a specific model predicted a rejection.
2.	Human Agency: There is a "Lack of human oversight documentation". The AI Act mandates that high-risk systems be designed to allow humans to oversee the system and override automated decisions.
